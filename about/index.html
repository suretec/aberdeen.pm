<tbody><tr><td><h3><font face="Arial">About Aberdeen.pm</font></h3></td><td></td></tr><tr>
</tr><tr><td><p>Aberdeen.pm is the Aberdeen, Scotland chapter of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a>
organisation. Perl Mongers is a worldwide association of perl user
groups, and in the coming weeks and months, it's hoped that Aberdeen.pm
will get off the ground as an honest-to-goodness perl user group for
Aberdeen and the Aberdeenshire area. Anyone is free to join, although
face-to-face meeting is of course restricted to members in the Aberdeen
area at the time of the meeting :).</p>
<p>It is hoped that regular meetings, online tutorials, and of course,
lively discourse (not necessarily related to perl) on the mailing list
will ensue.</p>
<p>At present, Aberdeen.pm is managed by Gavin henry, of <a href="http://www.suretecsystems.com" title="Suretec" alt="Suretec">Suretec Systems Ltd.</a>, whose contact details are available as the manager of Aberdeen.pm on <a href="http://www.pm.org/">www.pm.org</a></p>

<p>Many Thanks to Dave O Connor, of the <a href="http://dublin.pm.org">Dublin.pm</a>, for letting me steal his site templates for a temporary site.</p>
